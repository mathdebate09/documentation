Already A Tailwind Pro? We're glad to have you here! We'll get you up and running with NativeFlow in less than 5 mins so that you can focus more on writing native code instead of reading styles, OOPS! stylesheets docs

## Installation

```bash title="terminal"
npm i nativeflowcss
```

## Syntax

The UI library offers similar syntax to Tailwind, with a few nuances in its class naming conventions.
>**PS**: It helps us staying closer to the React Native ecosystem and develop a zero-deps library

- We use `.` instead of `-`
- We use `()` isntead of `[]`
- you need to wrap your custom properties with `""`
>ex. `flex.justify("space-around")`

And that's it! You're good to start working on your native app ğŸ¥³
