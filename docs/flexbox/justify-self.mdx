import SnackPlayer from "@site/src/components/SnackPlayer";

Custom alignment for individual items (Native workaround for the CSS equivalent).

## How

Adding `flexDirection` to a component's style determines the **primary axis** of its layout.

Adding `alignItems` to a component's style determines the alignment of children
along the **secondary axis** (if the primary axis is row, then the secondary is column, and vice versa).

## Workaround

<SnackPlayer id="@mathdebate09/justify-self" />

## Summary

So the best solution is two wrap the element which you want to apply `justifySelf` with a `<View />` component
and apply `flexDirection` to the parent and get the desired alignment using `align` or `justify`.
