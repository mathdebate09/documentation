How to input your desired values for various utility style-objects.

## Similarities with Tailwind

- 'Almost' same utility names
- Similar environment setup (custom autoprefixer prettier -plugin && Intellisense under development)

## Syntax

There's usually a parent object which has sub-keys which spill the stylesheet object from the library

- Tailwind uses `-` | NativeFlow uses `_`
- Tailwind uses `[]` | NativeFlow uses `()`
- There's a minor `import` step you'll need to do manually (for now ðŸ˜‰), copy it from the [fundamentals](/docs/fundamentals) section
