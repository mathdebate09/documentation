Reusing a stylesheet made using NativeFlow utility objects

<div className="thought-box">
Jay I don't wanna make my style property cluttered and use the good'ol `StyleSheet.create()`, is there any way to implement utility-objects in the stylesheet?
</div>

## Why Destructure

- More consistency in design systems
- Extended reusability (like a lot, really lot)
- Aren't these two points good enough make it smoother to use NativeFlow in big codebases?

## How-to Destructure

Javascript provides object destructring through the spread operator (`...someObject`), we can utilize it to implement utility objects in the `StyleSheet.create()` Native function

```js title="src/screens/LoginPage.js"
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { p, m, align, justify } from "nativeflowcss";

// Creating a custom container
const container = StyleSheet.create({
  ...p.x_12,
  ...m.y_6,
  ...align.items_center,
  ...justify.center,
});
```
