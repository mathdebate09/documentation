How the syntax system works, what flaws the other approach has that NativeFlow fixes

## Why NativeFlow ?

The regular way to write styles in a React Native project is primarily through stylesheet objects, 
using properties a lot similar to the [CSS for Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) 
but using the CSS-in-JS type of syntax.

The CSS-in-JS type of properties are verbose and take a bit of workaround to get running up due to newer namespaces, etc.

<SnackPlayer id="@mathdebate09/react-native-vanilla" />

<br />

<div className="thought-box">
So while preserving the Native approach, we get up running with shorter syntax, with NativeFlow
</div>

<br />

<SnackPlayer id="@mathdebate09/react-native-flow" />

<br />

**You can focus on the design, we'll make it quicker for you**

## We use utility-objects, not classes, but why?

- React Native was naturally meant to work around with stylesheet **objects** not classNames
- We forcefully started injecting tailwind with the help of babel which worked fine, but breaks sometimes, more than often
- The babel-injected approach also lacked animations and platform specific properties like `elevation` or `borderCurve`
- And why should we hassle if we can stay close to the environment

## Imports

The only 'caveat' in using NativeFlow is, uhh... *Imports*, these being style objects need to be manually imported from the library, You can keep referring this section for Iports until something tasty is being cooked üçõ

### Common Imports

```jsx
import { p, m, flex, align, text, justify, bdr, fx, h } from "nativeflowcss";
```

### Everything Imports

```jsx
import { p, m, flex, align, justify, place, text, decoration, w, h, size, fx, shadow, aspect, object_fit, display, direction, pos, z, overflow } from "nativeflowcss";
```
