**Let's get working with NativeFlow, staying close to React-Native Fundamentals with concise syntax.**

**Zero dependency-approach, clean and minimal Javascript objects to make your life bug-free!**

## Installation

Install the npm package for NativeFlow classes

```bash title="terminal"
npm i nativeflowcss
```

## Imports

Add your desired UI classes from the library to be used in your project
> Checkout the [fundamentals](/docs/fundamentals#imports) page for the <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> - <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd> stuff

```jsx title="src/components/Card.js"
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native'
import { p, m, flex } from 'nativeflowcss'
```

## Babel && Prettier

<div class="img-width">

</div>

You might've guessed by now, yep, dependency-free library! No extra setup required.

You can make your own deps if you want to have a customised workflow, sky's the limit.

:::info[automated imports]
A vs-code extension for automatically importing the classes is under progress, contribute to it on [NativeFlow - Intellisense repository](https://github.com/nativeflowteam/intellisense)
