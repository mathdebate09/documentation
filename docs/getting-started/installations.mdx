**Let's get working with NativeFlow, staying close to React-Native Fundamentals with concise syntax.**

**Zero dependency-approach, clean and minimal Javascript objects to make your life bug-free!**

## Installation

Install the npm package for NativeFlow classes

```bash title="terminal"
npm i nativeflowcss
```

## Imports

Add your desired UI classes from the library to be used in your project

```jsx title="src/components/Card.jsx"
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native'
import { p, m, flex } from 'nativeflowcss'
```

:::tip[automated imports]
A vs-code extension for automatically importing the classes is under progress, contribute to it on [FlowImports repository](https://github.com/nativeflowteam/flowimports)
