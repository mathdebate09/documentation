How is NativeFlow different from Tailwind (syntax-wise)

## Differences

There's usually a parent object which has sub-keys which spill the stylesheet object from the library

- Tailwind uses `-`, NativeFlow uses `_` for joining words
- Tailwind uses `[]`, NativeFlow uses `()` for taking custom value inputs
- You need to wrap your custom properties with `""` (for numbers, it works without strings as well)
- There's a minor `import` step you'll need to do manually (for now ðŸ˜‰), copy it from the [fundamentals](/docs/fundamentals) section

> Ex. `bdr.rounded_("33")`

## Why?

All these nuances are being done so that we can use objects. 
JavaScript does not allow using hyphens (`-`), numbers (in the first position of key).

Also we can create a function as a key on the parent object which can spill stylesheet objects with custom values.
